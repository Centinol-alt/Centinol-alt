## About me
Started coding by vibe coding a small Telegram bot for fun. After a few small projects, I built Zettle Notes, a note-taking app, entirely through vibe coding. So now I cry while reading docs at 3am, or in other words: I've taken an interest in programming, and now Iâ€™m learning the fundamentals to grow as a developer using AI to help speed up the whole "self-taught" arc. Oh and, Neovim btw.
