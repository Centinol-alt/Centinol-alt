Yo, I’m Centinol

I’m a code-slinging gremlin who builds apps to fix the world’s annoyances—one line at a time. My projects are equal parts “Eureka!” and “Why is this breaking at 3 AM?” I thrive on turning pain points into slick solutions, usually with a side of caffeine-fueled chaos.

What I Do

- Craft apps that make life less infuriating—think smoother workflows, fewer headaches.
- Speak fluently in JavaScript, Python, and the occasional primal scream when regex betrays me.
- Solve problems by diving into the mess, whether it’s buggy APIs, clunky UX, or just bad vibes in the codebase.
- Embrace the chaos of debugging, refactoring, and the eternal question: “Did I push that commit?”

Stuff I’ve Built

- Zettle Notes - A note-taking app to fix [specific pain point]. Built with [tech stack]. [website](https://zettle-web.vercel.app).
- Family Tree - Tackled outdated and insecure genealogy apps with [tech stack]. It’s alive, and I only cried twice. [website].

The Vibe

- Code’s my canvas, and I paint with 50% genius, 50% “I’ll fix it tomorrow” energy.
- I’m all about practical solutions, not buzzword bingo. If it works, it’s good. If it doesn’t, we reboot or yeet.
- Collaboration? I’m your guy. I’ll bring the wit, grit, and git commits.
